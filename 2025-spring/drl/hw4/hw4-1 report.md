### Introduction

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for solving the Gridworld environment, a classic reinforcement learning (RL) problem. DQN is a value-based RL algorithm that uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value function, enabling agents to learn optimal policies in environments with high-dimensional state spaces.

### Key Components

1. **Gridworld Environment**  
   - A simple 4x4 grid-based game where an agent must reach a goal while avoiding traps.
   - The environment provides states, rewards, and allows actions (up, down, left, right).

2. **Neural Network Model**  
   - The Q-network is a multi-layer perceptron that takes the state as input and outputs Q-values for each possible action.
   - The model is trained using mean squared error (MSE) loss between predicted and target Q-values.

3. **Training Loop**  
   - The agent interacts with the environment using an Îµ-greedy policy (exploration vs. exploitation).
   - After each action, the agent receives a reward and updates the Q-network.
   - Experience replay and target networks are introduced to stabilize training and improve performance.

4. **Experience Replay**  
   - Stores past experiences in a buffer and samples mini-batches for training.
   - Helps break correlations between consecutive samples and improves learning efficiency.

5. **Target Network**  
   - A separate network used to compute target Q-values, updated less frequently to reduce overestimation bias.

6. **Evaluation**  
   - The trained model is tested in both static and random Gridworld settings to evaluate its performance and generalization.

### Learning Outcomes

- Understand how DQN combines Q-learning with deep learning to solve RL problems.
- Learn the importance of experience replay and target networks in stabilizing DQN training.
- Gain practical experience in implementing and tuning DQN for a simple environment.
